Before we dive into building real-world Java applications, let’s start with the basics—but not in a boring way.

This section gives you a solid grounding in what makes Java unique, powerful, and still relevant today. Whether you're completely new to Java or returning after a break, you’ll find this section valuable for both understanding the *why* and *how* of Java development.

You’ll learn:

* What Java really is and why it has stood the test of time
* The roles of the JDK and JVM, and how they work behind the scenes
* How to set up Java on your system (Windows or Linux) using `.zip` or `.tar.gz` downloads
* How Java source code becomes executable programs
* And finally, you’ll write, compile, and run your very first Java program

No fluff, no overcomplication—just the essential foundation you need to move forward with confidence.

Let’s get started.
