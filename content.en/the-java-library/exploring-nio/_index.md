#Exploring NIO
*******

Beginning with version 1.4, Java has provided a second I/O system called NIO _(_which is short for _New I/O_). It supports a buffer-oriented, channel-based approach to I/O operations. With the release of JDK 7, the NIO system was greatly expanded, providing enhanced support for file-handling and file system features. In fact, so significant were the changes that the term _NIO.2_ is often used. Because of the capabilities supported by the NIO file classes, NIO is expected to become an increasingly important approach to file handling. This chapter explores several of the key features of the NIO system.

## The NIO Classes

 The NIO classes are contained in the packages shown here. Beginning with JDK 9, all are in the **java.base** module.

Before we begin, it is important to emphasize that the NIO subsystem does not replace the stream-based I/O classes found in **java.io**, which are discussed in Chapter 21, and good working knowledge of the stream-based I/O in **java.io** is helpful to understanding NIO.  

**NOTE**

 This chapter assumes that you have read the overview of I/O given in Chapter 13 and the discussion of stream-based I/O supplied in Chapter 21.

## NIO Fundamentals

 The NIO system is built on two foundational items: buffers and channels. A buffer holds data. A channel represents an open connection to an I/O device, such as a file or a socket. In general, to use the NIO system, you obtain a channel to an I/O device and a buffer to hold data. You then operate on the buffer, inputting or outputting data as needed. The following sections examine buffers and channels in more detail.

## Buffers

 Buffers are defined in the **java.nio** package. All buffers are subclasses of the **Buffer** class, which defines the core functionality common to all buffers: current position, limit, and capacity. The _current position_ is the index within the buffer at which the next read or write operation will take place. The current position is advanced by most read or write operations. The limit is the index value one past the last valid location in the buffer. The capacity is the number of elements that the buffer can hold. Often the limit equals the capacity of the buffer. **Buffer** also supports mark and reset. **Buffer** defines several methods, which are shown in Table 22-1.  

**Table 22-1** The Methods Defined by **Buffer**

From **Buffer**, the following specific buffer classes are derived, which hold the type of data that their names imply:

## MappedByteBuffer

 is a subclass of **ByteBuffer** and is used to map a file to a buffer.

All of the aforementioned buffers provide various **get()** and **put()** methods, which allow you to get data from a buffer or put data into a buffer. (Of course, if a buffer is read-only, then **put()** operations are not available.) Table 22-2 shows the **get()** and **put()** methods defined by **ByteBuffer**. The other buffer classes have similar methods. All buffer classes also support methods that perform various buffer operations. For example, you can allocate a buffer manually using **allocate()**. You can wrap an array inside a buffer using **wrap()**. You can create a subsequence of a buffer using **slice()**.  

**Table 22-2** The **get()** and **put()** Methods Defined for **ByteBuffer**

## Channels

 Channels are defined in **java.nio.channels**. A channel represents an open connection to an I/O source or destination. Channels implement the **Channel** interface. It extends **Closeable**, and it extends **AutoCloseable**. By implementing **AutoCloseable**, channels can be managed with a **try**\-with- resources statement. When used in a **try**\-with-resources block, a channel is closed automatically when it is no longer needed. (See Chapter 13 for a  

discussion of **try**\-with-resources.) One way to obtain a channel is by calling **getChannel()** on an object that

supports channels. For example, **getChannel()** is supported by the following I/O classes:

The specific type of channel returned depends upon the type of object **getChannel()** is called on. For example, when called on a **FileInputStream**, **FileOutputStream**, or **RandomAccessFile**, **getChannel()** returns a channel of type **FileChannel**. When called on a **Socket**, **getChannel()** returns a **SocketChannel**.

Another way to obtain a channel is to use one of the **static** methods defined by the **Files** class. For example, using **Files**, you can obtain a byte channel by calling **newByteChannel()**. It returns a **SeekableByteChannel**, which is an interface implemented by **FileChannel**. (The **Files** class is examined in detail later in this chapter.)

Channels such as **FileChannel** and **SocketChannel** support various **read()** and **write()** methods that enable you to perform I/O operations through the channel. For example, here are a few of the **read()** and **write()** methods defined for **FileChannel**:  

All channels support additional methods that give you access to and control over the channel. For example, **FileChannel** supports methods to get or set the current position, transfer information between file channels, obtain the current size of the channel, and lock the channel, among others. **FileChannel** provides a **static** method called **open()**, which opens a file and returns a channel to it. This provides another way to obtain a channel. **FileChannel** also provides the **map()** method, which lets you map a file to a buffer.

## Charsets and Selectors

 Two other entities used by NIO are charsets and selectors. A charset defines the way that bytes are mapped to characters. You can encode a sequence of characters into bytes using an encoder. You can decode a sequence of bytes into characters using a decoder. Charsets, encoders, and decoders are supported by classes defined in the **java.nio.charset** package. Because default encoders and decoders are provided, you will not often need to work explicitly with charsets.

A selector supports key-based, non-blocking, multiplexed I/O. In other words, selectors enable you to perform I/O through multiple channels. Selectors are supported by classes defined in the **java.nio.channels** package. Selectors are most applicable to socket-backed channels.

We will not use charsets or selectors in this chapter, but you might find them useful in your own applications.  

them useful in your own applications.

**Enhancements Added by NIO.2** Beginning with JDK 7, the NIO system was substantially expanded and enhanced. In addition to support for the **try**\-with-resources statement (which provides automatic resource management), the improvements included three new packages (**java.nio.file**, **java.nio.file.attribute**, and **java.nio.file.spi**); several new classes, interfaces, and methods; and direct support for stream- based I/O. The additions have greatly expanded the ways in which NIO can be used, especially with files. Several of the key additions are described in the following sections.

## The Path Interface

 Perhaps the single most important addition to the NIO system was the **Path** interface because it encapsulates a path to a file. As you will see, **Path** is the glue that binds together many of the NIO.2 file-based features. It describes a fileâ€™s location within the directory structure. **Path** is packaged in **java.nio.file**, and it inherits the following interfaces: **Watchable**, **Iterable<Path>**, and **Comparable<Path>**. **Watchable** describes an object that can be monitored for changes. The **Iterable** and **Comparable** interfaces were described earlier in this book.

## Path

 declares a number of methods that operate on the path. A sampling is shown in Table 22-3. Pay special attention to the **getName()** method. It is used to obtain an element in a path. It works using an index. At index zero is the part of the path nearest the root, which is the leftmost element in a path. Subsequent indexes specify elements to the right of the root. The number of elements in a path can be obtained by calling **getNameCount()**. If you want to obtain a string representation of the entire path, simply call **toString()**. Notice that you can resolve a relative path into an absolute path by using the **resolve()** method.  

**Table 22-3** A Sampling of Methods Specified by **Path**  

Beginning with JDK 11, an important new **static** factory method called **of()** was added to **Path**. It returns a **Path** instance from either a path name or a URI. Thus, **of()** gives you a way to construct a new **Path** instance.

One other point: When updating legacy code that uses the **File** class defined by **java.io**, it is possible to convert a **File** instance into a **Path** instance by calling **toPath()** on the **File** object. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain a **File** instance by calling the **toFile()** method defined by **Path**.

## The Files Class

 Many of the actions that you perform on a file are provided by **static** methods within the **Files** class. The file to be acted upon is specified by its **Path**. Thus, the **Files** methods use a **Path** to specify the file that is being operated upon. **Files** contains a wide array of functionality. For example, it has methods that let you open or create a file that has the specified path. You can obtain information about a **Path**, such as whether it is executable, hidden, or read- only. **Files** also supplies methods that let you copy or move files. A sampling is shown in Table 22-4. In addition to **IOException**, several other exceptions are possible. **Files** also includes these four methods: **list()**, **walk()**, **lines()**, and **find()**. All return a **Stream** object. These methods help integrate NIO with the stream API described in Chapter 29. Beginning with JDK 11, **Files** also includes the methods **readString()** and **writeString()**, which returns a **String** containing the characters in a file or writes a **CharSequence** (such as a **String**) to a file.  

**Table 22-4** Commonly Used Listener Interfaces Implemented by Adapter Classes

Notice that several of the methods in Table 22-4 take an argument of type **OpenOption**. This is an interface that describes how to open a file. It is implemented by the **StandardOpenOption** class, which defines an enumeration that has the values shown in Table 22-5.  

**Table 22-5** The Standard Open Options

## The Paths Class

 Because **Path** is an interface, not a class, you canâ€™t create an instance of **Path** directly through the use of a constructor. Instead, you obtain a **Path** by a calling a method that returns one. Prior to JDK 11, you would typically do this by using the **get()** method defined by the **Paths** class. There are two forms of **get()**. The first is shown here:

static Path get(String pathname, String ... parts)

It returns a **Path** that encapsulates the specified path. The path can be specified in two ways. First, if parts is not used, then the path must be specified in its entirety by pathname. Alternatively, you can pass the path in pieces, with the first part passed in pathname and the subsequent elements specified by the parts varargs parameter. In either case, if the path specified is syntactically invalid, **get()** will throw an **InvalidPathException**.

The second form of **get()** creates a **Path** from a **URI**. It is shown here:

static Path get(URI uri)  

The **Path** corresponding to uri is returned. Although the **Paths.get()** method just described has been in use since JDK 7

and, at the time of this writing, is still available for use, it is no longer recommended. Instead, the Java API documentation for JDK 11 recommends the use of the new **Path.of()** method, which was added by JDK 11. Because of this, **Path.of()** is now the preferred approach. Of course, if you are using a compiler that predates JDK 11, then you must continue to use **Paths.get()**.

It is important to understand that obtaining a **Path** to a file does not open or create a file. It simply creates an object that encapsulates the fileâ€™s directory path.

## The File Attribute Interfaces

 Associated with a file is a set of attributes. These attributes include such things as the fileâ€™s time of creation, the time of its last modification, whether the file is a directory, and its size. NIO organizes file attributes into several different interfaces. Attributes are represented by a hierarchy of interfaces defined in **java.nio.file.attribute**. At the top is **BasicFileAttributes**. It encapsulates the set of attributes that are commonly found in a variety of file systems. The methods defined by **BasicFileAttributes** are shown in Table 22-6.

**Table 22-6** The Methods Defined by **BasicFileAttributes**  

From **BasicFileAttributes** two interfaces are derived: **DosFileAttributes** and **PosixFileAttributes**. **DosFileAttributes** describes those attributes related to the FAT file system as first defined by DOS. It defines the methods shown here:

## PosixFileAttributes

 encapsulates attributes defined by the POSIX standards. (POSIX stands for _Portable Operating System Interface._) It defines the methods shown here:

There are various ways to access a fileâ€™s attributes. First, you can obtain an object that encapsulates a fileâ€™s attributes by calling **readAttributes()**, which is a **static** method defined by **Files**. One of its forms is shown here:

static <A extends BasicFileAttributes> A readAttributes(Path path, Class<A> attrType, LinkOption... opts)

throws IOException

This method returns a reference to an object that specifies the attributes associated with the file passed in path. The specific type of attributes is specified as a **Class** object in the attrType parameter. For example, to obtain the basic file attributes, pass **BasicFileAttributes.class** to attrType. For DOS attributes, use **DosFileAttributes.class**, and for POSIX attributes, use **PosixFileAttributes.class**. Optional link options are passed via opts. If not specified, symbolic links are followed. The method returns a reference to requested attributes. If the requested attribute type is not available, **UnsupportedOperationException** is thrown. Using the object returned, you can access the fileâ€™s attributes.  

A second way to gain access to a fileâ€™s attributes is to call **getFileAttributeView()** defined by **Files**. NIO defines several attribute view interfaces, including **AttributeView**, **BasicFileAttributeView**, **DosFileAttributeView**, and **PosixFileAttributeView**, among others. Although we wonâ€™t be using attribute views in this chapter, they are a feature that you may find helpful in some situations.

In some cases, you wonâ€™t need to use the file attribute interfaces directly because the **Files** class offers **static** convenience methods that access several of the attributes. For example, **Files** includes methods such as **isHidden()** and **isWritable()**.

It is important to understand that not all file systems support all possible attributes. For example, the DOS file attributes apply to the older FAT file system as first defined by DOS. The attributes that will apply to a wide variety of file systems are described by **BasicFileAttributes**. For this reason, these attributes are used in the examples in this chapter.

**The FileSystem, FileSystems, and FileStore Classes** You can easily access the file system through the **FileSystem** and **FileSystems** classes packaged in **java.nio.file**. In fact, by using the **newFileSystem()** method defined by **FileSystems**, it is even possible to obtain a new file system. The **FileStore** class encapsulates the file storage system. Although these classes are not used directly in this chapter, you may find them helpful in your own applications.

## Using the NIO System

 This section illustrates how to apply the NIO system to a variety of tasks. Before beginning, it is important to emphasize that beginning with JDK 7, the NIO subsystem was greatly expanded. As a result, its uses have also been greatly expanded. As mentioned, the enhanced version is sometimes referred to as NIO.2. Because the features added by NIO.2 are so substantial, they have changed the way that much NIO-based code is written and have increased the types of tasks to which NIO can be applied. Because of its importance, the remaining discussion and examples in this chapter utilize NIO.2 features and, therefore, require a modern version of Java.

In the past, the primary purpose of NIO was channel-based I/O, and this is still a very important use. However, you can now use NIO for stream-based I/O and for performing file-system operations. As a result, the discussion of using  

and for performing file-system operations. As a result, the discussion of using NIO is divided into three parts:

- Using NIO for channel-based I/O
- Using NIO for stream-based I/O
- Using NIO for path and file system operations

Because the most common I/O device is the disk file, the rest of this chapter uses disk files in the examples. Because all file channel operations are byte- based, the type of buffers that we will be using are of type **ByteBuffer**.

Before you can open a file for access via the NIO system, you must obtain a **Path** that describes the file. In the past, one way to do this was to call the **Paths.get()** factory method, which has been available since JDK 7. However, as explained earlier, beginning with JDK 11, the preferred approach is to use **Path.of()** rather than **Paths.get()**. Because of this, the examples use **Path.of()**. If you are using a version of Java prior to JDK 11, simply substitute **Paths.get()** for **Path.of()** in the programs. The form of **of()** used in the examples is shown here:

static Path of(String pathname, String ... parts)

Recall that the path can be specified in two ways. It can be passed in pieces, with the first part passed in pathname and the subsequent elements specified by the parts varargs parameter. Alternatively, the entire path can be specified in pathname and parts is not used. This is the approach used by the examples.

**Use NIO for Channel-Based I/O** An important use of NIO is to access a file via a channel and buffers. The following sections demonstrate some techniques that use a channel to read from and write to a file.

## Reading a File via a Channel

 There are several ways to read data from a file using a channel. Perhaps the most common way is to manually allocate a buffer and then perform an explicit read operation that loads that buffer with data from the file. It is with this approach that we begin.

Before you can read from a file, you must open it. To do this, first create a **Path** that describes the file. Then use this **Path** to open the file. There are various ways to open the file depending on how it will be used. In this example,  

the file will be opened for byte-based input via explicit input operations. Therefore, this example will open the file and establish a channel to it by calling **Files.newByteChannel()**. The version of **newByteChannel()** that we will use has this general form:

static SeekableByteChannel newByteChannel(Path path, OpenOption ... how) throws IOException

It returns a **SeekableByteChannel** object, which encapsulates the channel for file operations. The **Path** that describes the file is passed in path. The how parameter specifies how the file will be opened. Because it is a varargs parameter, you can specify zero or more comma-separated arguments. (The valid values were discussed earlier and shown in Table 22-5.) If no arguments are specified, the file is opened for input operations. **SeekableByteChannel** is an interface that describes a channel that can be used for file operations. It is implemented by the **FileChannel** class. When the default file system is used, the returned object can be cast to **FileChannel**. You must close the channel after you have finished with it. Since all channels, including **FileChannel**, implement **AutoCloseable**, you can use a **try**\-with-resources statement to close the file automatically instead of calling **close()** explicitly. This approach is used in the examples.

Next, you must obtain a buffer that will be used by the channel either by wrapping an existing array or by allocating the buffer dynamically. The examples use allocation, but the choice is yours. Because file channels operate on byte buffers, we will use the **allocate()** method defined by **ByteBuffer** to obtain the buffer. It has this general form:

static ByteBuffer allocate(int cap)

Here, cap specifies the capacity of the buffer. A reference to the buffer is returned.

After you have created the buffer, call **read()** on the channel, passing a reference to the buffer. The version of **read()** that we will use is shown next:

int read(ByteBuffer buf) throws IOException

Each time it is called, **read()** fills the buffer specified by buf with data from the file. The reads are sequential, meaning that each call to **read()** reads the next bufferâ€™s worth of bytes from the file. The **read()** method returns the number of bytes actually read. It returns â€“1 when there is an attempt to read at the end of the file.  

The following program puts the preceding discussion into action by reading a file called **test.txt** through a channel using explicit input operations:  

Here is how the program works. First, a **Path** object is obtained that contains the relative path to a file called **test.txt**. A reference to this object is assigned to **filepath**. Next, a channel connected to the file is obtained by calling **newByteChannel()**, passing in **filepath**. Because no open option is specified, the file is opened for reading. Notice that this channel is the object managed by the **try**\-with-resources statement. Thus, the channel is automatically closed when the block ends. The program then calls the **allocate()** method of **ByteBuffer** to allocate a buffer that will hold the contents of the file when it is read. A reference to this buffer is stored in **mBuf**. The contents of the file are then read, one buffer at a time, into **mBuf** through a call to **read()**. The number of bytes read is stored in **count**. Next, the buffer is rewound through a call to **rewind()**. This call is necessary because the current position is at the end of the buffer after the call to **read()**. It must be reset to the start of the buffer in order for the bytes in **mBuf** to be read by calling **get()**. (Recall that **get()** is defined by **ByteBuffer**.) Because **mBuf** is a byte buffer, the values returned by **get()** are bytes. They are cast to **char** so the file can be displayed as text. (Alternatively, it is possible to create a buffer that encodes the bytes into characters and then read that buffer.) When the end of the file has been reached, the value returned by **read()** will be â€“1. When this occurs, the program ends, and the channel is automatically closed.

As a point of interest, notice that the program obtains the **Path** within one **try** block and then uses another **try** block to obtain and manage a channel linked to that path. Although there is nothing wrong, per se, with this approach, in many cases, it can be streamlined so that only one **try** block is needed. In this approach, the calls to **Path.of()** and **newByteChannel()** are sequenced together. For example, here is a reworked version of the program that uses this approach:  

In this version, the variable **filepath** is not needed and both exceptions are handled by the same **try** statement. Because this approach is more compact, it is the approach used in the rest of the examples in this chapter. Of course, in your own code, you may encounter situations in which the creation of a **Path** object needs to be separate from the acquisition of a channel. In these cases, the previous approach can be used.

Another way to read a file is to map it to a buffer. The advantage is that the buffer automatically contains the contents of the file. No explicit read operation is necessary. To map and read the contents of a file, follow this general procedure. First, obtain a **Path** object that encapsulates the file as previously described. Next, obtain a channel to that file by calling **Files.newByteChannel()**, passing in the **Path** and casting the returned object to **FileChannel**. As explained, **newByteChannel()** returns a **SeekableByteChannel**. When using the default file system, this object can be cast to **FileChannel**. Then, map the channel to a buffer by calling **map()** on the channel. The **map()** method is defined by **FileChannel**. This is why the cast to **FileChannel** is needed. The **map()** function is shown here:

MappedByteBuffer map(FileChannel.MapMode how, long pos, long size) throws IOException

The **map()** method causes the data in the file to be mapped into a buffer in memory. The value in how determines what type of operations are allowed. It must be one of these values:

For reading a file, use **MapMode.READ_ONLY**. To read and write, use **MapMode.READ_WRITE**. **MapMode.PRIVATE** causes a private copy of the file to be made, and changes to the buffer do not affect the underlying file. The location within the file to begin mapping is specified by pos, and the number of bytes to map are specified by size. A reference to this buffer is returned as a **MappedByteBuffer**, which is a subclass of **ByteBuffer**. Once the file has been mapped to a buffer, you can read the file from that buffer. Here is an example that illustrates this approach:  

In the program, a **Path** to the file is created and then opened via **newByteChannel()**. The channel is cast to **FileChannel** and stored in **fChan**. Next, the size of the file is obtained by calling **size()** on the channel. Then, the entire file is mapped into memory by calling **map()** on **fChan** and a reference to the buffer is stored in **mBuf**. Notice that **mBuf** is declared as a reference to a **MappedByteBuffer**. The bytes in **mBuf** are read by calling **get()**.

## Writing to a File via a Channel

 As is the case when reading from a file, there are also several ways to write  

data to a file using a channel. We will begin with one of the most common. In this approach, you manually allocate a buffer, write data to that buffer, and then perform an explicit write operation to write that data to a file.

Before you can write to a file, you must open it. To do this, first obtain a **Path** that describes the file and then use this **Path** to open the file. In this example, the file will be opened for byte-based output via explicit output operations. Therefore, this example will open the file and establish a channel to it by calling **Files.newByteChannel()**. As shown in the previous section, the **newByteChannel()** method that we will use has this general form:

static SeekableByteChannel newByteChannel(Path path, OpenOption ... how) throws IOException

It returns a **SeekableByteChannel** object, which encapsulates the channel for file operations. To open a file for output, the how parameter must specify **StandardOpenOption.WRITE**. If you want to create the file if it does not already exist, then you must also specify **StandardOpenOption.CREATE**. (Other options, which are shown in Table 22-5, are also available.) As explained in the previous section, **SeekableByteChannel** is an interface that describes a channel that can be used for file operations. It is implemented by the **FileChannel** class. When the default file system is used, the return object can be cast to **FileChannel**. You must close the channel after you have finished with it.

Here is one way to write to a file through a channel using explicit calls to **write()**. First, obtain a **Path** to the file and then open it with a call to **newByteChannel()**, casting the result to **FileChannel**. Next, allocate a byte buffer and write data to that buffer. Before the data is written to the file, call **rewind()** on the buffer to set its current position to zero. (Each output operation on the buffer increases the current position. Thus, it must be reset prior to writing to the file.) Then, call **write()** on the channel, passing in the buffer. The following program demonstrates this procedure. It writes the alphabet to a file called **test.txt**.  

It is useful to emphasize an important aspect of this program. As mentioned, after data is written to **mBuf**, but before it is written to the file, a call to **rewind()** on **mBuf** is made. This is necessary in order to reset the current position to zero after data has been written to **mBuf**. Remember, each call to **put()** on **mBuf** advances the current position. Therefore, it is necessary for the  

current position to be reset to the start of the buffer before calling **write()**. If this is not done, **write()** will think that there is no data in the buffer.

Another way to handle the resetting of the buffer between input and output operations is to call **flip()** instead of **rewind()**. The **flip()** method sets the value of the current position to zero and the limit to the previous current position. In the preceding example, because the capacity of the buffer equals its limit, **flip()** could have been used instead of **rewind()**. However, the two methods are not interchangeable in all cases.

In general, you must reset the buffer between read and write operations. For example, assuming the preceding example, the following loop will write the alphabet to the file three times. Pay special attention to the calls to **rewind()**.

Notice that **rewind()** is called between each read and write operation. One other thing about the program warrants mentioning: When the buffer is

written to the file, the first 26 bytes in the file will contain the output. If the file **test.txt** was preexisting, then after the program executes, the first 26 bytes of **test.txt** will contain the alphabet, but the remainder of the file will remain unchanged.

Another way to write to a file is to map it to a buffer. The advantage to this approach is that the data written to the buffer will automatically be written to the file. No explicit write operation is necessary. To map and write the contents of a file, we will use this general procedure. First, obtain a **Path** object that encapsulates the file and then create a channel to that file by calling **Files.newByteChannel()**, passing in the **Path**. Cast the reference returned by **newByteChannel()** to **FileChannel**. Next, map the channel to a buffer by  

calling **map()** on the channel. The **map()** method was described in detail in the previous section. It is summarized here for your convenience. Here is its general form:

MappedByteBuffer map(FileChannel.MapMode how, long pos, long size) throws IOException

The **map()** method causes the data in the file to be mapped into a buffer in memory. The value in how determines what type of operations are allowed. For writing to a file, how must be **MapMode.READ_WRITE**. The location within the file to begin mapping is specified by pos, and the number of bytes to map are specified by size. A reference to this buffer is returned. Once the file has been mapped to a buffer, you can write data to that buffer, and it will automatically be written to the file. Therefore, no explicit write operations to the channel are necessary.

Here is the preceding program reworked so that a mapped file is used. Notice that in the call to **newByteChannel()**, the open option **StandardOpenOption.READ** has been added. This is because a mapped buffer can either be read-only or read/write. Thus, to write to the mapped buffer, the channel must be opened as read/write.  

As you can see, there are no explicit write operations to the channel itself. Because **mBuf** is mapped to the file, changes to **mBuf** are automatically reflected in the underlying file.

## Copying a File Using NIO

 NIO simplifies several types of file operations. Although we canâ€™t examine them all, an example will give you an idea of what is available. The following program copies a file using a call to a single NIO method: **copy()**, which is a **static** method defined by **Files**. It has several forms. Here is the one we will be  

using:

static Path copy(Path src, Path dest, CopyOption ... how) throws IOException

The file specified by src is copied to the file specified by dest. How the copy is performed is specified by how. Because it is a varargs parameter, it can be missing. If specified, it can be one or more of these values, which are valid for all file systems:

Other options may be supported, depending on the implementation. The following program demonstrates **copy()**. The source and destination

files are specified on the command line, with the source file specified first. Notice how short the program is. You might want to compare this version of the file copy program to the one found in Chapter 13. As you will find, the part of the program that actually copies the file is substantially shorter in the NIO version shown here.  

**Use NIO for Stream-Based I/O** Beginning with NIO.2, you can use NIO to open an I/O stream. Once you have a **Path**, open a file by calling **newInputStream()** or **newOutputStream()**, which are **static** methods defined by **Files**. These methods return a stream connected to the specified file. In either case, the stream can then be operated on in the way described in Chapter 20, and the same techniques apply. The advantage of using **Path** to open a file is that all of the features defined by NIO are available for your use.

To open a file for stream-based input, use **Files.newInputStream()**. It is shown here:  

static InputStream newInputStream(Path path, OpenOption ... how) throws IOException

Here, path specifies the file to open and how specifies how the file will be opened. It must be one or more of the values defined by **StandardOpenOption**, described earlier. (Of course, only those options that relate to an input stream will apply.) If no options are specified, then the file is opened as if **StandardOpenOption.READ** were passed.

Once opened, you can use any of the methods defined by **InputStream**. For example, you can use **read()** to read bytes from the file.

The following program demonstrates the use of NIO-based stream I/O. It reworks the **ShowFile** program from Chapter 13 so that it uses NIO features to open the file and obtain a stream. As you can see, it is very similar to the original, except for the use of **Path** and **newInputStream()**.  

Because the stream returned by **newInputStream()** is a normal stream, it can be used like any other stream. For example, you can wrap the stream inside a buffered stream, such as a **BufferedInputStream**, to provide buffering, as shown here:  

new BufferedInputStream(Files.newInputStream(Path.of(args[0])))

Now, all reads will be automatically buffered. To open a file for output, use **Files.newOutputStream()**. It is shown here:

static OutputStream newOutputStream(Path path, OpenOption ... how) throws IOException

Here, path specifies the file to open and how specifies how the file will be opened. It must be one or more of the values defined by **StandardOpenOption**, described earlier. (Of course, only those options that relate to an output stream will apply.) If no options are specified, then the file is opened as if **StandardOpenOption.WRITE**, **StandardOpenOption.CREATE**, and **StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING** were passed.

The methodology for using **newOutputStream()** is similar to that shown previously for **newInputStream()**. Once opened, you can use any of the methods defined by **OutputStream**. For example, you can use **write()** to write bytes to the file. You can also wrap the stream inside a **BufferedOutputStream** to buffer the stream.

The following program shows **newOutputStream()** in action. It writes the alphabet to a file called **test.txt**. Notice the use of buffered I/O.  

## Use NIO for Path and File System Operations

 At the beginning of Chapter 21, the **File** class in the **java.io** package was examined. As explained there, the **File** class deals with the file system and with the various attributes associated with a file, such as whether a file is read-only, hidden, and so on. It was also used to obtain information about a fileâ€™s path. Although the **File** class is still perfectly acceptable, the interfaces and classes defined by NIO.2 offer a better way to perform these functions. The benefits include support for symbolic links, better support for directory tree traversal, and improved handling of metadata, among others. The following sections show samples of two common file system operations: obtaining information about a path and file and getting the contents of a directory.

## REMEMBER

 If you want to change code that uses **java.io.File** to the **Path** interface, you can use the **toPath()** method to obtain a **Path** instance from a **File** instance.

## Obtain Information About a Path and a File

  

Information about a path can be obtained by using methods defined by **Path**. Some attributes associated with the file described by a **Path** (such as whether or not the file is hidden) are obtained by using methods defined by **Files**. The **Path** methods used here are **getName()**, **getParent()**, and **toAbsolutePath()**. Those provided by **Files** are **isExecutable()**, **isHidden()**, **isReadable()**, **isWritable()**, and **exists()**. These are summarized in Tables 22-3 and 22-4, shown earlier.

## CAUTION

 Methods such as **isExecutable(), isReadable(), isWritable(),** and **exists()** must be used with care because the state of the file system may change after the call, in which case a program malfunction could occur. Such a situation could have security implications.

Other file attributes are obtained by requesting a list of attributes by calling **Files.readAttributes()**. In the program, this method is called to obtain the **BasicFileAttributes** associated with a file, but the general approach applies to other types of attributes.

The following program demonstrates several of the **Path** and **Files** methods, along with several methods provided by **BasicFileAttributes**. This program assumes that a file called **test.txt** exists in a directory called **examples**, which must be a subdirectory of the current directory.  

If you execute this program from a directory called **MyDir**, which has a subdirectory called **examples**, and the **examples** directory contains the **test.txt** file, then you will see output similar to that shown here. (Of course, the information you see will differ.)

File Name: test.txt

Path: examples\\test.txt

Absolute Path: C:\\MyDir\\examples\\test.txt

Parent: examples

File exists

File is not hidden

File is writable

File is readable

The file is not a directory

The file is a normal file

The file is not a symbolic link

File last modified: 2017-01-01T18:20:46.380445Z

File size: 18 Bytes

If you are using a computer that supports the FAT file system (i.e., the DOS file system), then you might want to try using the methods defined by **DosFileAttributes**. If you are using a POSIX-compatible system, then try using **PosixFileAttributes**.

## List the Contents of a Directory

 If a path describes a directory, then you can read the contents of that directory by using **static** methods defined by **Files**. To do this, you first obtain a directory stream by calling **newDirectoryStream()**, passing in a **Path** that describes the directory. One form of **newDirectoryStream()** is shown here:

static DirectoryStream<Path> newDirectoryStream(Path dirPath) throws IOException

Here, dirPath encapsulates the path to the directory. The method returns a **DirectoryStream<Path>** object that can be used to obtain the contents of the directory. It will throw an **IOException** if an I/O error occurs and a **NotDirectoryException** (which is a subclass of **IOException**) if the specified path is not a directory. A **SecurityException** is also possible if access to the directory is not permitted.

**DirectoryStream<Path>** implements **AutoCloseable**, so it can be managed  

by a **try**\-with-resources statement. It also implements **Iterable<Path>**. This means that you can obtain the contents of the directory by iterating over the **DirectoryStream** object. When iterating, each directory entry is represented by a **Path** instance. An easy way to iterate over a **DirectoryStream** is to use a for- each style **for** loop. It is important to understand, however, that the iterator implemented by **DirectoryStream<Path>** can be obtained only once for each instance. Thus, the **iterator()** method can be called only once, and a for-each loop can be executed only once.

The following program displays the contents of a directory called **MyDir**:  

Here is sample output from the program:  

You can filter the contents of a directory in two ways. The easiest is to use this version of **newDirectoryStream()**:

static DirectoryStream<Path> newDirectoryStream(Path dirPath, String wildcard) throws IOException

In this version, only files that match the wildcard filename specified by wildcard will be obtained. For wildcard, you can specify either a complete filename or a glob. A glob is a string that defines a general pattern that will match one or more files using the familiar ***** and **?** wildcard characters. These match zero or more of any character and any one character, respectively. The following are also recognized within a glob:

You can specify a ***** or **?** character, using **\\*** and **\\?**. To specify a **\**, use **\\\**. You can experiment with a glob by substituting this call to **newDirectoryStream()** into the previous program:

Files.newDirectoryStream(Path.of(dirname), "{Path,Dir}*.

{java,class}")

This obtains a directory stream that contains only those files whose names begin with either "Path" or "Dir" and use either the "java" or "class" extension. Thus, it would match names like **DirList.java** and **PathDemo.java**, but not **MyPathDemo.java**, for example.

Another way to filter a directory is to use this version of **newDirectoryStream()**:

static DirectoryStream<Path> newDirectoryStream(Path dirPath, DirectoryStream.Filter<? super Path> filefilter)  

throws IOException

Here, **DirectoryStream.Filter** is an interface that specifies the following method:

boolean accept(T entry) throws IOException

In this case, **T** will be **Path**. If you want to include entry in the list, return **true**. Otherwise, return **false**. This form of **newDirectoryStream()** offers the advantage of being able to filter a directory based on something other than a filename. For example, you can filter based on size, creation date, modification date, or attribute, to name a few.

The following program demonstrates the process. It will list only those files that are writable.  

**Use walkFileTree() to List a Directory Tree** The preceding examples have obtained the contents of only a single directory. However, sometimes you will want to obtain a list of the files in a directory tree. In the past, this was quite a chore, but NIO.2 makes it easy because now you can use the **walkFileTree()** method defined by **Files** to process a directory tree. It has two forms. The one used in this chapter is shown here:

static Path walkFileTree(Path root, FileVisitor<? super Path> fv) throws IOException

The path to the starting point of the directory walk is passed in root. An instance of **FileVisitor** is passed in fv. The implementation of **FileVisitor** determines how the directory tree is traversed, and it gives you access to the directory information. If an I/O error occurs, an **IOException** is thrown. A **SecurityException** is also possible.

## FileVisitor

 is an interface that defines how files are visited when a directory tree is traversed. It is a generic interface that is declared like this:

interface FileVisitor<T>

For use in **walkFileTree()**, **T** will be **Path** (or any type derived from **Path**). **FileVisitor** defines the following methods:

Notice that each method returns a **FileVisitResult**. This enumeration defines  

the following values:

In general, to continue traversing the directory and subdirectories, a method should return **CONTINUE**. For **preVisitDirectory()**, return **SKIP_SIBLINGS** to bypass the directory and its siblings and prevent **postVisitDirectory()** from being called. To bypass just the directory and subdirectories, return **SKIP_SUBTREE**. To stop the directory traversal, return **TERMINATE**.

Although it is certainly possible to create your own visitor class that implements these methods defined by **FileVisitor**, you wonâ€™t normally do so because a simple implementation is provided by **SimpleFileVisitor**. You can just override the default implementation of the method or methods in which you are interested. Here is a short example that illustrates the process. It displays all files in the directory tree that has **\\MyDir** as its root. Notice how short this program is.  

Here is sample output produced by the program when used on the same **MyDir** directory shown earlier. In this example, the subdirectory called **examples** contains one file called **MyProgram.java**.

Directory tree starting with \\MyDir:

\\MyDir\\DirList.class

\\MyDir\\DirList.java

\\MyDir\\examples\\MyProgram.java

\\MyDir\\Test.txt

In the program, the class **MyFileVisitor** extends **SimpleFileVisitor**, overriding only the **visitFile()** method. In this example, **visitFile()** simply displays the  

files, but more sophisticated functionality is easy to achieve. For example, you could filter the files or perform actions on the files, such as copying them to a backup device. For the sake of clarity, a named class was used to override **visitFile()**, but you could also use an anonymous inner class.

One last point: It is possible to watch a directory for changes by using **java.nio.file.WatchService**.
