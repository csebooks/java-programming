Java’s standard library ships with a rich set of **utility classes**—batteries included—so you don’t have to reinvent common functions. In this chapter, we’ll explore the most useful helpers that make your code cleaner, safer, and more expressive.

You’ll see how to:

* Use **`java.util.Objects`** for null-safe operations and helpful checks
* Leverage **`java.util.Optional`** to handle potentially missing values without nulls
* Manipulate collections and arrays with **`java.util.Collections`**, **`Arrays`**, and streams
* Format and parse text or numbers via **`StringJoiner`**, **`Formatter`**, and **`Math`** utilities
* Work with dates, times, and locales using **`DateTimeFormatter`** and **`Locale`** helpers
* Tap into concurrency utilities—like **`AtomicInteger`**, **`Executors`**, and **`CompletableFuture`**—for safe, high-level threading

Each section will dive into one utility area: what problem it solves, how to use it effectively, and real-world examples you can drop into your projects. Let’s unlock the power of Java’s built-in tools.
