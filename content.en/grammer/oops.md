![Alt text](Oops.jpg "Object Oriented Programming in Java")

## Four main pillars of object oriented programming

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism


### Abstraction

---
> Only essential details are displayed to the user
> In hava it is achieved via Interfaces and Abstract classes
---

### Encapsulation

---
> Wrapping up of the data into a single unit
> data-hiding
> Variables are private and the methods are public
----

### Inheritance

----
* Mechanism to inherit the features of some class 
* Also known as is-a relationship 
* Super class vs Sub class 
* Reusability 
* Use `extends` keyword
---

### Polymorphism

---
> Ability to differentiate between entities with same name efficiently
---

#### Types of Polymorphism
* Method overloading / compile time
* Method overriding / runtime
