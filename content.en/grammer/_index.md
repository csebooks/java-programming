Now that you’ve set up your Java environment, structured your project, and run your first programs, it’s time to focus on the **language itself**—how Java speaks.

This chapter is all about understanding Java’s *grammar*—the building blocks and rules that make your code meaningful and executable.

We’ll cover the essential elements that every Java developer must know, from the simplest values to the more expressive constructs of object-oriented programming.

Here’s what you’ll learn:

* The different types of data Java can work with—**primitive types** (like numbers and booleans) and **object-based types** (like Strings and Records)
* How **keywords** give structure and meaning to your code
* How to control the flow of execution using **if/else**, **switch**, **loops**, and more
* Java’s **operators** and how to use them in expressions and logic
* The basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**—classes, objects, methods, and inheritance
* Newer language features like **Records** that simplify modeling data
* How these features come together in real, readable Java code

By the end of this chapter, you won’t just understand how Java works—you’ll be able to *write* Java fluently and clearly.

Let’s get fluent in Java’s grammar.
