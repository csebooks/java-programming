### Grammar Overview

Any language has a **grammar**—a set of rules that helps us form meaningful sentences. Java is no different. By understanding its grammar, we can read and write programs with clarity and confidence.

Let’s look at a simple example in English:

```
I am going to town.
```

Now, let's see how this would look word-by-word in another language—say Tamil:

| English  | Tamil   |
| -------- | ------- |
| I        | நான்    |
| am going | போறேன்  |
| to town  | ஊருக்கு |

As you can see, **a word-by-word translation doesn't always convey the actual meaning** unless we understand the **structure** and **relationships**.

### Reading Java Like a Language

Let’s apply the same idea to Java. When you see code, try reading it like a sentence. Here's a simple formula to help:

| Java Keyword/Concept | Meaning        |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| `extends`            | "is a"         |
| `implements`         | "is a kind of" |
| instance variable    | "has a"        |
| `generics`           | "of"           |

### Examples

```java
public class Person implements Animal {
    private String name;
}
```

Read it as:

> **Person** is a kind of **Animal** who has a **name**.

```java
public class Teacher extends Person {
}
```

> **Teacher** is a **Person**.

```java
List<Person> people;
```

> **people** is a **List of Person**.

### Simple, Isn’t It?

By using this pattern, you can train yourself to read any Java program **like reading a newspaper**.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to **understand any Java class or method just by reading**—just like reading a sentence in your native language.

Let’s begin!
