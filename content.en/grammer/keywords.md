title: 'Keywords'

Java has a fixed set of **reserved words** called **keywords**. These words have special meaning in the language and **cannot be used as variable, method, or class names**.

Think of them as the "grammar rules" Java uses to understand what you're trying to do.

### Examples by Category

#### Control Flow

These keywords control how code runs:

* `if`, `else` – decision-making
* `switch`, `case`, `default` – multiple condition branching
* `for`, `while`, `do` – loops
* `break`, `continue` – exit or skip loop blocks
* `return` – exit a method and optionally send a value back

#### Class & Object Structure

Used to define structure of programs:

* `class`, `interface`, `enum`, `record` – define types
* `extends`, `implements` – inheritance
* `this`, `super` – refer to current/parent object

#### Access Control

Used to define visibility:

* `public`, `private`, `protected` – who can access
* `static` – belongs to class, not instance
* `final` – value can’t be changed or method/class can’t be overridden

#### Modifiers & Utilities

* `abstract` – incomplete class or method
* `synchronized` – used in multithreading
* `transient`, `volatile` – used in serialization and memory control
* `native` – links to non-Java code (e.g., C)

#### Exception Handling

* `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws` – manage errors safely

#### Boolean Logic

* `true`, `false`, `null` – constants

#### Primitive Types

* `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, `long`, `float`

Java has **50+ keywords**, but you’ll become familiar with them naturally as you write more code. You don’t need to memorize them upfront—just recognize them and avoid using them for names.
