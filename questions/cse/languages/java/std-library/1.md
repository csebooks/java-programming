choices:
  - "Collection Streams API"
  - "Buffered Reader"
  - "Container"
matches:
  - "Builder"
  - "Decorator"
  - "Composite"
  - "Visitor"

explanation: |
  This question asks you to match Java components with their corresponding design patterns:
  - **Collection Streams API** follows the **Builder** pattern, as it allows building complex operations using a fluent interface.
  - **BufferedReader** uses the **Decorator** pattern to add functionality (like buffering) to readers without modifying their structure.
  - **Container** (like GUI containers or data structures) represents the **Composite** pattern, as it can hold multiple components and treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
