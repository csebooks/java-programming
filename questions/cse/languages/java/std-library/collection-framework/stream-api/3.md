  - "Compilation error"
answer:
  - "Runtime error"
explanation: "Streams in Java can only be consumed once. The first `numStream` is partially processed with `map`, but the mapped stream is discarded. When `forEach` is called on the same original stream object, it throws a `java.lang.IllegalStateException` at runtime because the stream was already operated upon or closed. The second `Stream.of(...).map(...).forEach(...)` chain would work, but the first part causes the error before it executes."

Given the code fragment:  
`Stream<Integer> numStream = Stream.of(10, 20, 30);`  
`numStream.map(n -> n * 10);`  
`numStream.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));`  

`Stream.of(10, 20, 30).map(n -> n * 10).forEach(n -> { System.out.println(n); });`  

What is the result?
