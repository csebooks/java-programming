  "question": "Match the following",
  "explanation": "This question asks you to match Java components with their corresponding design patterns:\n- **Collection Streams API** follows the **Builder** pattern, as it allows building complex operations using a fluent interface.\n- **BufferedReader** uses the **Decorator** pattern to add functionality (like buffering) to readers without modifying their structure.\n- **Container** (like GUI containers or data structures) represents the **Composite** pattern, as it can hold multiple components and treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.",

    {
