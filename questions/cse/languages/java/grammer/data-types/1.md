  - "Compilation Error"
  - "Runtime Error"
  - "None of the above"
answer:
  - "Access Modifier"

explanation: "In Java, methods within an enum must be declared after all enum constants, and should follow proper syntax. Here, the method 'isWekkend' is declared directly after the constants without a separating semicolon and curly braces block. Also, access modifiers like 'protected' are not commonly used directly within enum constant lists. The correct approach is to place the method in a proper block after a semicolon. Additionally, the method is missing a return statement for all cases, and there's a typo in the method name ('isWekkend' instead of 'isWeekend')."

## What is the issue in the below code?

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY;
    
    protected isWekkend(Day day) {
        return day == SATURDAY;
    }
}
