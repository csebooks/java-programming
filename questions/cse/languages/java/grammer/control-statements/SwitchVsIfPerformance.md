choices:
  - "Switch uses more memory"
  - "If-else is faster for all conditions"
  - "Switch is easier to debug"
  - "Switch allows faster execution due to compiler optimizations"
answer:
  - "Switch allows faster execution due to compiler optimizations"

explanation: "Modern compilers may optimize `switch` statements into jump tables or lookup tables, improving execution speed when compared to sequential `if-else` chains."
